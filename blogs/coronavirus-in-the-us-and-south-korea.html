        As the COVID-19 pandemic stretches into its sixth month, many countries
        around the world are cautiously returning to normal life, attempting to
        maintain a delicate balance between public and economic health. However,
        this has been met with varying success, perhaps most clearly seen in the
        stark contrast between the progression of the virus in the United States
        and South Korea.

        <br /><br />It’s hard to recall the beginning of March when the two
        countries were both experiencing their first major spikes in case
        counts. Yet, in the subsequent days and weeks, governments of each
        country adopted radically different policies, a reflection of the vast
        divide between the individuality central to the American identity and
        the collectivist mindset of South Koreans. While both nations have
        managed to remain afloat, it is undeniable that South Korea has seen
        much greater success in containing COVID-19.

        <b>Decoding infections disease models</b>
        <br /><br />Everyone remotely interested in the news has observed the
        wild fluctuations in the predictions of the United States COVID-19
        forecasting model over the past few months, from a high of over a
        million deaths to an already-surpassed low of 60 thousand. As of June
        27, the
        <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">current death toll is 127,000</a>
        and continues to rise in America.
        Meanwhile, in Korea, there have only been
        <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">282 deaths</a>, with only ten
        fatalities in the last three weeks. <br /><br />We know that the elderly
        and those with underlying health conditions are much more likely to die
        from COVID-19. But how does the government determine the overall
        trajectory of case numbers and fatalities for an entire nation?
        <br /><br />There are dozens of variables in these models, but
        epidemiologists are all ultimately using one single algorithm: a system
        of differential equations. This essentially means that researchers are
        estimating how different factors, such as travel patterns or weather,
        will change over time, and how that will impact the spread of the
        disease. <br /><br />This culminates in a single number: the R<sub
          >0</sub
        >
        rate. This metric, also known as the reproduction number, describes the
        average number of people that will be infected by a person that has the
        disease. The only way to end the pandemic will be to reduce and sustain
        the R<sub>0</sub> rate below 1, where each infection cycle will contain
        fewer cases. <br /><br />The initial outbreak in Wuhan had an estimated
        <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">R<sub>0</sub> value of between 2.2 and 2.7</a>, with each infection cycle
        being approximately four days -- this means that it only takes
        approximately 3.3 days for that value to be doubled, which suggests that
        it would only take 100 days after the first infection for the entire
        world to have caught COVID-19 at least once. Fortunately, this did not
        happen -- through a series of draconian measures and a 76-day citywide
        lockdown, R<sub>0</sub> rates were quickly brought down to approximately
        0.3, ending the epidemic almost as quickly as it had started.
        <br /><br />As the pandemic progresses throughout the world,
        epidemiologists are able to gain greater insight into the evolution of
        COVID-19 in and across populations, and the impact of various factors
        such as the availability of personal protective equipment on the
        long-term R0 curve. Due to the extreme differences between COVID-19 and
        other coronaviruses such as SARS or MERS, initial models were extremely
        inaccurate; even now, half a year after the first case was reported,
        models are little more than a representation of current trends.

        <br /><b>What did America do wrong? </b> <br /><br />When COVID-19 was
        first detected in the United States in late January, it is likely that
        many cases have already spread unnoticed, therefore establishing
        community transmission. The lack of a centralized healthcare institution
        in America and the nation’s vast geographical expanse make it virtually
        impossible to gather reliable data of the beginning of the pandemic;
        however,
        <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">statistics from the European Union and other developed countries</a>
         suggest that metropolitan centers would have initially started
        with a R<sub>0</sub> value of 3.5 to 4.5, while rural areas were
        slightly better off with a rate of 1.2 to 2.4. <br /><br />Throughout
        February and the beginning of March, most states adopted the federal
        government’s laid-back attitude towards containing the virus. With only
        a few hundred reported cases, authorities mistakenly believed that
        community transmission was not sustainable and simply issued travel
        advisories for China and other nations experiencing outbreaks. However,
        these numbers were simply a reflection of the severe lack of testing
        kits available -- by March 1, only 399 people had been tested for
        COVID-19, and 97% of the tests were returned positive.
        <br /><br />Meanwhile, in South Korea, a sudden outbreak of cases in
        mid-February led to rapid investigation by the government, who
        determined the site of origination just two days later -- the
        Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu. Immediately, social distancing
        guidelines were enforced, face masks were distributed and worn by the
        vast majority of citizens and most crucially,
        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-covid-19-tests-per-day?time=2020-02-08..2020-06-14&country=IND~IDN~NZL~ZAF~KOR~GBR" target="_blank">tens of thousands of tests</a>
        were conducted each day through an incredibly effective contact tracing
        campaign. Within three weeks, the outbreak was contained, with less than
        50 people contracting COVID-19 per day. <br /><br />Despite never
        enforcing any mandatory stay-at-home orders, South Korea brought its
        <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">R<sub>0</sub> value from an initial high of 10 down to 0.7, and managed</a>
        to suppress its rise since. America has not been nearly as fortunate:
        with the disease spreading to new cities and sparking new waves every
        other day, over the past 100 days,
        <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.20104653v3" target="_blank">only 7 have had an estimated R<sub
          >0</sub
        >
        of less than 1</a>.<br /><br />From an economic standpoint, there is no
        significant difference in the strategies pursued by both nations.
        Compared to the rest of the world, both governments have sought to
        minimize disruption in the economy by leaving self-protection largely to
        the individual. Stimulus packages and a mature technology infrastructure
        have facilitated a relatively smooth transition for those unable to work
        at physical offices and hospitals have staved off being overwhelmed by
        cases. An argument can be made that Americans have actually experienced
        stricter regulations than their Korean counterparts -- many cities and
        states issued stay-at-home orders for extended periods of time, and a
        significant number of restaurants and other businesses were shuttered.
        <br /><br />Many Americans have come to realize this, and are
        justifiably frustrated. However, the nation is failing to see the root
        of the problem: the politicization of a public health crisis.
        <br /><br /><b>Moving forward</b> <br /><br />The American identity is
        encapsulated in three words: freedom, individuality and opportunity.
        This ideology, that one should be free to follow and express their own
        beliefs freely, has been the propelling force behind the United States’
        rise to becoming the sole global superpower for the past century.
        However, the past few months have seen millions of Americans abuse their
        rights, from the average citizen to the leaders of the United States.
        <br /><br />Even as tens of thousands of Americans get infected with
        COVID-19 each day, many protestors continue to refuse to wear face masks
        or oblige by social distancing measures, drawing on the populist
        conception of personal liberty. The current administration’s inability
        to coordinate a nationwide effort to fight the pandemic has led to a
        fragmented system of policies and recommendations that ultimately fail
        to impose any real long-term changes to our society. Perhaps most
        worrying is the rejection of science by many populists in favor of “the
        people’s interests” -- the refusal to sacrifice any personal freedom for
        the common good has allowed the virus to proliferate throughout
        communities, even as the vast majority of Americans are under
        self-imposed lockdown. <br /><br />

        <br />Perhaps it is time for the United States to look outwards, and
        learn from the success of other countries. We must set aside ideological
        differences and start learning to work with the government, rather than
        blindly fight it. Although we may not be able to replicate the
        efficiency of South Korea in defeating the coronavirus, this nation will
        only succeed when it no longer battles itself, but rather the enemy.
