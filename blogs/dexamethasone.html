            <br><br>A common steroid known as Dexamethasone reduced deaths in patients with severe cases
             of COVID-19 recently in Britain, the
             <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20200617&instance_id=19462&nl=the-morning&regi_id=93214710&segment_id=31113&te=1&user_id=fddd68b618c3d9c4cb93eefc958556b5" target="_blank";>New York Times</a>
                reports. According to researchers,
              around 5,000 deaths could have been prevented as the drug protects the tissues
               by reducing inflammation.
            <br><br>The nationwide
            <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/" target="_blank";>Recovery Trial</a>,
           which aims to identify potential treatments for COVID-19,
             announced that "a low-dose regimen of dexamethasone for 10 days was found to reduce the risk of
              death by a third among hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in the trial,"
              <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/health/dexamethasone-covid-drug-recovery-trial-bn/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> reports.
              <br><br>According to
                <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/dexamethasone-oral-route/description/drg-20075207" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>,
                   Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that has been used since the
               1960s to treat conditions such as asthma, skin conditions, adrenal problems, arthritis,
                and even severe allergies. It is available on the shelf as a relatively inexpensive product,
                and has been listed on the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines
                since 1977 in multiple formulations.
              <br><br>"Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19. This is an
               extremely welcome result," Peter Horby, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Nuffield
                Department of Medicine, University of Oxford told
                <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dexamethasone-coronavirus-death-risk-severe-cases-study/" target="_blank";>CBS News</a>.
              <br><br>Many doctors and renowned healthcare specialists are also calling this discovery a "major breakthrough."
              <br><br>WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, even congratulated the University of Oxford and
              hospitals in the UK on the contributions to the findings. However, the
              <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/16-06-2020-who-welcomes-preliminary-results-about-dexamethasone-use-in-treating-critically-ill-covid-19-patients" target="_blank";>World Health Organization</a>
               clarifies that
              the benefit was only seen in patients with life-threatening cases of COVID-19. Their latest news release details
              how they will "coordinate a meta-analysis to increase...overall understanding of [the] intervention."
              <br><br>WHO clinical guidance will then be updated to reflect how and when the drug should be used in COVID-19.
              <br><br>Nevertheless, others are still skeptical about the validity of its effects. "After all the retractions
              and walk backs, it is unacceptable to tout study results by press release without releasing the paper," Dr. Atul
               Gawande, surgeon and author, said in a tweet.
               <br><br>Currently, there is no vaccine against coronavirus and remdesivir is the only antiviral drug proven to be effective.
               <br><br>"We hope the data on which these results are based will be published as soon as possible so that doctors
                can confidently put the treatment into practice," Robin Ferner, honorary professor of clinical
                 pharmacology at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/clinical-sciences/Ferner-Robin.aspx" target="_blank";>University of Birmingham</a>
                  told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/health/dexamethasone-covid-drug-recovery-trial-bn/index.html" target="_blank";>CNN</a>.
