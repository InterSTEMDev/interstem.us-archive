          <br />Throughout the search for a possible vaccine or cure to the
          quickly spreading COVID-19, over 100 countries have joined the World
          Health Organization (WHO) in its international effort to evaluate four
          of the world‚Äôs top candidates in stamping out the virus.
          <br /><br /><b>What is WHO?</b> <br /><br />WHO, also known as the
          World Health Organization, is a large contributor to the fight against
          the spread of COVID-19. Announced on
          <a

          phase III-IV clinical trials held internationally in hopes of both
          speeding up the time required to produce effective medicine and
          requiring fewer COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms to be tested
          upon.
          <br /><br /><b>Four Candidates for COVID-19 Treatments</b>
          <br /><br />It was recently announced as of June. 17 that the first
          among the four candidates was being dropped from further examinations
          and test trials. Originally intended as an antimalarial drug,
          <a
            href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/009768s037s045s047lbl.pdf"

            ;
            >hydroxychloroquine</a
          >
          is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) which targets the
          disease in the body rather than alleviating the symptoms caused by the
          disease. Generally, DMARDs such as hydroxychloroquine inhibit B and T
          cells to suppress overactive immune system responses. However, during
          periods of tests, it was found to be neither detrimental nor
          beneficial to hospitalized patients.
          <br /><br />The second among the four is an antiviral drug known as
          remdesivir that was made to target Hepatitis C and eventually used on
          patients with Ebola. In order to virally replicate, Sars-Cov-2
          requires the presence of
          <a
            href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1499"
            target="_blank"
            ;
            >RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase</a
          >
          (RdRp).
          <a
            href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Remdesivir#section=Pharmacology"
            target="_blank"
            ;
            >Remdesivir</a
          >
          is a complex incorporated by RdRp that stops the complete synthesis of
          RNA required for viral replication. Although there are serious side
          effects implicated as a medication such as organ impairments,
          countless studies indicate that this could be the most promising
          treatment and that potential benefits outweigh the risks involved.
          Already, the drug has been found to shorten infection periods.
          <br /><br />A third choice is a combination of the antiretroviral
          medicines, lopinavir and ritonavir. These medications are both HIV
          medications, inhibiting HIV proteases which prevents HIV viruses from
          latching onto and invading healthy cells. However in an
          <a
            href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282"
            target="_blank"
            ;
            >experiment</a
          >
          in which 99 patients were treated with the antiretroviral drugs and
          standard care and 100 patients were treated with simply standard care,
          there was not much observable change between the two groups in both
          the mortality rate and viral RNA detection. This indicates a lack in
          effectiveness of this particular treatment.
          <br /><br />The last option was presented as the inclusion of
          interferon ùõΩ in addition to the lopinavir‚Äîritonavir combination. The
          primary role of interferon ùõΩ is to reduce the immune system response
          by inhibiting interferon ùõæ which is what starts the inflammatory
          process during infection. In a
          <a
            href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31042-4/fulltext"
            target="_blank"
            ;
            >research study</a
          >, the presence of interferon ùõΩ in comparison to just the
          lopinavir‚Äîritonavir treatment was found to reduce symptoms and viral
          shedding, thus reducing the hospitalization duration for patients with
          mild to moderate cases of Covid-19. <br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b>
          <br /><br />Steven Hawking once said, ‚ÄúHowever bad life may seem,
          there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there is
          life, there is hope.‚Äù <br /><br />It is true that a cure has not been
          developed yet, and most vaccines take several years minimum to
          develop. Yet as mankind races against time, developing the Solidarity
          trials, which are designed to reduce approximately 80% of the required
          time for testing a vaccine, there will soon be a solution to the
          COVID-19 pandemic. <br /><br />
