       <div class="words">
        <br><br> The attempt to contain COVID-19 has led to a global lockdown and the sudden halt of all travel.
          Most of the world is quarantined. Planes have been grounded in efforts to minimize the spread of the virus.
          During this uncertain time for us all, the climate has been given a long, needed break.
          Industries and businesses are confined to their homes resulting in low usage of fossil fuels.
           This has caused historic changes in the climate.
           <br><br>
           No previous pandemic, recession, or war had such a significant effect on the climate.
           Populous cities like Delhi and Beijing can now see the blue sky that was hiding behind
            the polluted air. According to
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts" target="_blank";>The Guardian</a>,
            China alone saw a 40% decrease in nitrogen
             dioxide and a 25% decrease in PM2.5 which are both dangerous air pollutants. This is a
             result of the major cutbacks in oil and coal usage. Oil refineries in China alone have
             seen the lowest coal consumption since 2015. And carbon dioxide emissions in China have
             been 25% lower in January than it was in 2019. These effects have also been seen in
             Europe and the United States. According to
             <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/drop-in-air-pollution-over-northeast/" target="_blank";>NASA</a>,
             nitrogen dioxide levels have decreased
              by 30% across Boston and Washington, D.C during these 5 years. The grounding of most
               airlines has also reduced air pollution as
               <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/severe-reduction-emissions-coronavirus-mitigate-climate-change-long/story?id=69334246" target="_blank";>air travel has decreased</a>
                by 4.3%.
          <br><br>
          Furthermore,
          <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions" target="_blank";>Carbon Briefs</a>
           estimates that carbon emissions will drop by 2 billion tonnes in 2020.
          They predict that this will be the lowest drop in carbon historically. This is a step in the right
           direction as polluted air is responsible for 8 million deaths annually. According to
          <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts" target="_blank";>Marshall Burke at Stanford University</a>,
            over 1,400 juvenile deaths and 51,700 senior deaths have been
            avoided due to better air quality in the past few months.
            <br><br>Despite these promising results, this change is fragile and temporary,
            as carbon emissions are likely to skyrocket once containment measures are lifted.
        <br><br>Carbon emissions in China have started to go back to normal in April as containment
         measures have been eased. Similar effects may be seen once all lockdown measures have been lifted.
          This is no surprise, as experts agree that disrupting so many lives is not an effective and permanent
           way to reduce emissions. Furthermore, this massive drop is impressive but nowhere near the amount
           needed to keep the average global temperature under two degrees. According to the
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3l90xrPaQ" target="_blank";>Voice of America</a>,
            to stay under two degrees, global emissions need to decrease by 2.7% each year this decade.
            Counterintuitively, the sudden drop in pollutants can heat the Earth even faster as particles
          in the atmosphere shields us from the sun. This suggests that Earth needs a gradual and consistent
          decrease in emissions, rather than a short complete cutback.
          <br><br>To achieve this, investments in renewable energy need to be made quickly and the pandemic
           may allow that. Experts hope that the visible benefits seen in the climate during the pandemic will
            encourage world leaders to consider clean energy. Industries may adopt greener methods to conduct
             business as they have been doing during the lockdown. These adjustments need to be implemented
             quickly in order to remain under the two degrees limit by the end of the decade.
