       </div>
       <br>While examining collective human behavior due to appeals of mass cooperation, behavioral psychologists
       from various parts of the world have made speculations about the different behaviors of individuals based
        on the
       <a href="https://www.brainsway.com/knowledge-center/mental-health-education/how-your-personality-might-affect-how-you-handle-covid-19" target="_blank";>Big Five personality traits</a>
        (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience)
         during the COVID-19 lockdown. The relationship between the personality and behavior of individuals during
         the COVID-19 lockdown is something important to keep in mind during this time as it may offer vital insight
          as to why certain people act differently in a crisis such as COVID-19.
      <br><br>According to an article from
      <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-s-mind-is-yours/202006/why-personality-matters-in-pandemic" target="_blank";>Psychology Today</a>,
      extraversion, a personality trait demonstrated
       with higher assertiveness and sociability, has a notable impact on the response of individuals to
        the COVID-19 lockdown. Individuals with higher levels of extraversion are less likely to social
         distance and adhere to government-issued safety practices. On the other hand, those who are more
          introverted are more likely to follow social distancing measures. This is evident across social
          media platforms, as extroverted individuals tend to deviate from social distancing practices,
           by going to public places like the beach, more frequently than introverts.
      <br><br>
      <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294713/" target="_blank";>Conscientiousness</a>
       is a personality trait shown by the tendency to be organized and responsible.
      Those with high conscientiousness are more likely to adhere to the rules of social distancing and practice
      hygiene to protect themselves and others. However, those with lower conscientiousness are less likely to
       wash their hands and wear a mask, despite the impact their actions can have on the rest of society.
        Neuroticism is a personality trait that describes the tendency to be more moody and emotional.
        Those with higher levels of neuroticism are more likely to follow personal restrictions in order
         to protect others from COVID-19 but adversely are also more susceptible to psychological disorders
         such as depression, anxiety and PTSD from the socially isolating conditions of the lockdown.
         Their moods may change very easily and the pandemic may have a large, negative impact on their
         mental health compared to those with lower levels of neuroticism.
    <br><br>The other two of the Big Five personality traits, agreeableness and openness to experience,
    may also affect the behavior of individuals during this pandemic. Those with higher agreeableness
    are more likely to be cooperative with social distancing measures while maintaining an optimistic
     outlook on the situation. Conformity and compliance come easier to those with higher agreeableness,
      as they tend to avoid questioning the judgment of others in positions higher than themselves.
       Those with higher openness to experience may be more open-minded to the COVID-19 situation and
        see it as an experience they can learn from.
    <br><br>In addition to the Big Five personality traits, self-efficacy, an individualâ€™s belief in their capacity
     to execute behaviors necessary to produce a specific outcome, has an effect on how an individual
      may react to COVID-19. Those with lower self-efficacy are more susceptible to feeling helpless
      and anxious during the pandemic. Self-efficacy and locus of control, which is how strongly an individual
       believes they have control over their lives, are correlated. For example, individuals with a lower
        self-efficacy showed a stronger external locus of control, meaning that they believe their successes
        or failures are attributed to external factors such as luck or fate. In the meantime,
         those with higher self-efficacy have a more internal locus of control, meaning that
         they believe they can control the outcome of events in their lives. Although self-efficacy
         is not considered a Big Five personality trait, it can still impact the behavior of individuals
         during this pandemic.
    <br><br>So why is this important? Viewing the masses as individuals may be helpful for learning
    how to better cope with this pandemic. It is always beneficial to self-reflect and understand yourself
    in order to grow and develop self-awareness. Knowing your personality traits during this time ultimately
    plays a large role in understanding the behaviors and feelings of others and yourself. It may even be something
    for experts to consider during this highly stressful time.
