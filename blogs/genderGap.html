       </h5>

       <br>The current situation with COVID-19 has significantly affected public health and the economy. However, this crisis also threatens to widen the current gender wage gap, as well as to exacerbate gender-based violence and generate new inequalities that women will have to face in their homes.
       <br><br>In general terms,
       <a href="http://www.oas.org/es/cim/docs/ArgumentarioCOVID19-EN.pdf" target="_blank";>women are poorer than men</a>.
        Women tend to work more in the informal sector than men, especially in underdeveloped countries, and statistics show that due to the sectors of the economy women tend to work in, the social distancing measures affect women more. Therefore, the active participation of women in paid work after COVID-19 will be essential for their economic improvement and for the early economic revival of countries.

       </div>

       <br>In addition,
        <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/21/the-covid-19-gender-gap/" target="_blank";>more women tend to work in the social sectors</a>,
       such as hotels and restaurants, retail and service industries, which have been most affected by the quarantine. As a result, women are more likely to have lost their jobs. It should also be noted that due to the nature of their jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. According to the
      <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/21/the-covid-19-gender-gap/" target="_blank";>International Monetary Fund</a>,
         in the United States, approximately 54% of women who work in social sectors cannot do so remotely.

       <br>However, gender inequality during this pandemic is not limited to the economic inequalities women face. Women are also more
       <a href="https://blogs.iadb.org/ideas-matter/en/gender-gaps-in-the-time-of-covid-19/" target="_blank";>vulnerable to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse</a>
        during the lockdowns; statistics show a growth in gender-based violence particularly in Latin American countries. We have to be aware that compulsory isolation is not safe for everyone. Many women have to decide between going out and risking contagion to report the abuse they suffer or resign themselves to being further assaulted. The ability to report assaults during the crisis and receive protection has been diminished due to isolation. In some countries with
        <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/05/15/covid-19-could-worsen-gender-inequality-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean" target="_blank";>available statistics</a>,
        family violence has doubled or even tripled. For example, in Colombia, calls to the domestic violence hotline increased by 91% since the quarantine was imposed.
       <br><br><a href="https://blogs.iadb.org/ideas-matter/en/gender-gaps-in-the-time-of-covid-19/" target="_blank";>Recent studies</a>
       allow us to clearly understand how violence against women is being triggered during confinement, emphasizing the deep psychological imprint the pandemic leaves behind. For example, a
      <a href="https://blogs.iadb.org/ideas-matter/en/gender-gaps-in-the-time-of-covid-19/" target="_blank";>study in the U.S.</a>
       suggests that the pandemic unlocked episodes of domestic violence even in families without a pre-existing history of intrahousehold violence
       <br><br>Furthermore,
      <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/21/the-covid-19-gender-gap/" target="_blank";>women do most of the unpaid housework</a>,
       approximately 2.7 hours more than men. During confinement, women are the ones who have to bear the burden of family responsibilities, such as caring for children and the elderly, as well as the domestic chores. This work is not equally distributed but falls mainly on women and their work is not valued socially nor economically.
       <br><br>In conclusion, governments and international agencies must take up the challenge of generating long-term policies to address gender inequality. Particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, greater efforts must be made. Governments must devote themselves to creating policies to reduce the negative effects of the crisis on women and avoid further setbacks to the progress toward gender equality.
       <br><br>"We must address the gender dimension in our response to COVID-19," social scientist at the World Bank and co-author of the reports Closing the Gender Gaps in Latin America and the Caribbean and Gender Dimensions of the COVID-19 Pandemic Miriam Müller said. "However, this crisis also highlights the need to eradicate gender inequality forever.”
