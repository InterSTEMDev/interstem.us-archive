         The weak nuclear force and why it's important</span>

    <br>Since the dawn of time, our universe has been governed by four fundamental
    forces that help physicists explain the universe. The first of these forces to be
     discovered, and the weakest, is gravity. Gravity is known by most as a force that
      pulls light objects towards heavy objects. Since it was first theorized by Isaac
       Newton in 1687, its principle has been further developed through quantum mechanics,
       and Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
      <br><br>The second weakest force, electromagnetism, is the force that governs
       the interactions of charged particles and magnetic fields. It is carried by
        the photon, and it is responsible for attractive and repulsive forces in
        charged atoms, chemical reactions, and other phenomena related to energy.
    <br><br>The strong nuclear force is the force that binds quarks together using
     gluon energy and binds protons to neutrons. It explains why the mass of an atom's
     nucleus is slightly smaller than the mass of its protons and neutrons combined, as
     some of the mass of the subatomic particles is converted into binding energy, as
     proven by the theory of special relativity.
    <br><br>Finally, there is the weak nuclear force, which acts on subatomic levels
     and went undiscovered until 1983. You might be wondering what the purpose of
      this force is and why it is fundamental to our understanding of the universe.

    </div>
    <br>The origins of the weak nuclear force dates back to 1933 when physicist
    Enrico Fermi explained beta decay as an event that was governed by a weak
    interaction, which was responsible for turning a neutron into a proton,
     a beta particle (electron), and a neutrino. Fermi concluded that this
     process was caused by an adhesive force that required two particles to
      be touching in order to take action. It was later proven, however, that
      this explanation was false, as a team from

      <a href="https://www.livescience.com/49254-weak-force.html" target="_blank";>Georgia State University</a>

      found
       that it was a cohesive force that acted at an extremely short range
       (8.7e-19 meters).

       </div>
    <br>Like the electromagnetic force carried by photons, and the
     strong nuclear force being carried by gluons, the weak nuclear force
      is carried by the W and Z bosons. It is believed that the W boson is
       responsible for being able to change the flavor of a quark (an example
        being an up quark changing to a down quark). This allows the neutron
         to be changed into a proton (or vice versa) in processes like beta
         decay and nuclear fusion, due to the W boson being found with both
          positive and negative charges. The Z boson, on the other hand, is
           difficult to observe, as scientists have trouble detecting its
            interactions with other particles. Many studies involving the
             Z boson are inconclusive.

<br>The weak nuclear force is very important to our understanding
of the universe. This is seen through its presence in experiments, and
natural processes like beta decay and nuclear fusion. It has shaped our
 world through its force-carrying particles and its role in nuclear
 chemistry. The W boson’s role in nuclear fusion is what makes stars
 burn, and causes stars to form heavier elements, many of which are
 essential to life on Earth. Famous physicist
 <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-11-weak-forcelife-couldnt.html" target="_blank";>David Armstrong</a>
  once
 said, "If the weak interaction were significantly stronger than it
  is, then the sun would have burned out years ago." In conclusion,
  the weak nuclear force is essential to physicists in their conquest
  to study the nature of the universe.
